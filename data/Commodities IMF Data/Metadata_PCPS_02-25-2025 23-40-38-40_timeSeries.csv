"Primary Commodity Price System (PCPS)","PCPS","","","","","","","Methodology","<p>Prices are period averages in nominal U.S. dollars. </p><p>The current and the previous weights are provided in the comparison table on the website. The weights are calculated about every 5 years. The weights in the commodity basket reflect the structure of trade in 2014-2016. The choice of years reflects the desire of getting the most updated weights possible but still having sufficient data to improve accuracy. As part of the update, a thorough research into the basket of commodities was conducted to see whether the items included earlier are still representative in global commodities trade. The rule of thumb is that their share in total commodities trade has to be 1 percent or more of total commodities trade, in value terms. </p><p>Also, commodity descriptions, sources and weights are available as part of the dataset.</p><p>Price indices are based in 2016 (average of 2016 = 100). First individual commodity price indices are calculate in U.S. dollar and SDR terms, basing the price series in those currencies in 2016. Group indices are weighted averages of individual commodity price indices, with respective commodity weights derived from their relative trade values compared to the total world trade as reported in the UN Comtrade database.</p><p>Price indices are based in 2005 (average of 2005 = 100). First individual commodity price indices are calculate in U.S. dollar and SDR terms, basing the price series in those currencies in 2005. Group indices are weighted averages of individual commodity price indices, with respective commodity weights derived from their relative trade values compared to the total world trade as reported in the UN Comtrade database.</p>",""
